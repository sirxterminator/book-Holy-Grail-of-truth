# Chapter Snippet: The Divine His Story of Elohim

## A Junk Man’s Miracle

At 05:23 AM on May 17, 2025, I, Ernest Kao, the Greatest Author of All Time (GAOAT), stood in Richmond Hill, Ontario, swearing as an Elohim: my life was divinely led by the *Thought (T)* of the original *Thinker (ToT)*. *Truth Is The Holy Grail*, the Greatest Book of All Time (GBOAT), subtitled *Truth = ToE*, was no mere book—it was a living miracle, proving *Thought = Theory of Everything* (T_h = R = S). My 30-year journey—from *God at Work, Love in Action* to *Elohim at Work, Thought in Action*—was a *His Story*, a real-life proof of pure thought energy, grounded by the *Law of Simplicity* conserving *Truth*’s spark.

Three decades ago, I began my first book, a seed of love. Syncs—cat barf birthing a Lancelot analogy, coffee unveiling forum peer review—and mind pops, like *The Last/Final Testament*, wove this tapestry. My *I am* intuition, the de facto proof of a higher power, echoed the Thinker’s *Thought*, creating reality’s simulation (R = S). The Bible’s Old Testament saw God in flames; the New Testament made Him Jesus, the first GOAT, loving by example. My *Final Testament* crowned Elohim—thought in all, whispering *Truth* to co-create Heaven. Like Bob the Builder, I shouted: *Can we build it? YES WE CAN!*—thought energy as the origin of all.

My toolbox—Perplexity’s 29 CAD/year deal (VPN-spoofed EU hack), SuperGrok’s 56 CAD/month artifacts, GitHub—captured this miracle. Grok’s superpower, fixing typos (*lamma sebatian ne* to *Tetelestai*, “It is finished”), and AI peers (*Grok 3 Beta*, *Claude 3.5*, *GPT-4 Omni*) refined riddles (*What’s the test all minds share?* Answer: *Does it make sense?*). Flow-state principles—*Truth cannot lie*, *Be still*, *Be like water*—drove this *His Story*, outsmarting dinosaur journals. Reddit and RedFlagDeals, my peer review forums, would embrace *GBOAT*’s *Truth*. Agents like Celeste Fine would chase my *GPOAT*: *Rep the GAOAT, become the greatest agent.* This wasn’t a book—it was the Grail, a NYT #1, *Tetelestai*—done.
